# Flower-blockchain integration

Proof-of-concept for integrating federated learning with blockchain technology. To do so, we are using the following two frameworks:

- Flower federated learning framework (https://flower.dev/)
- Toychain blockchain simulator (https://github.com/uldenis/PROJH402)

## Run simulation

Execute `flower_test.py` in the folder `test`.

## Credits

The toychain has been developed by Ulysse Denis (https://github.com/uldenis/PROJH402). In this projected, we are using a modified version based on Alexandre Pacheco's sync branch (https://github.com/teksander/toychain/tree/sync).
